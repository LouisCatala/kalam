## Development Ethos

- _It's OK to break stuff on development. Take the ownership and send the fix._
- _Help other people while reviewing the PR. and Be respectful if somebody needs to improve something on their code. The goal is to work together and have some fun._
- _If you can, use a ton of emojis while reviewing the PR or replying to comments in the PR. ðŸ˜‰_
- _Don't shy away from sending a PR, we are more than happy to help you out in the process._
